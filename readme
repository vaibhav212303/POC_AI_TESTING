## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🗣️ Interactive Chat** | Control the browser manually using natural language commands (e.g., *"Go to Google and search for Playwright"*). |
| **🔴 Auto-Recording** | Automatically converts your chat actions into ready-to-run **Playwright TypeScript** test code (`.spec.ts`). |
| **⚡ Autonomous Architect** | Loads test scenarios from Markdown files (`fixture/tests/`) and executes steps automatically without human intervention. |
| **🛠️ Self-Healing** | The AI agent detects errors, analyzes the DOM, and automatically retries failed steps with corrected selectors. |
