# 🤖 AI Browser Automation Suite (POC)

A dual-mode AI testing framework that combines **Interactive Chat** with **Autonomous Workflows**. 
Powered by **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**, **Playwright**, and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## 🌟 Features

- **🗣️ Interactive Chat Mode**: Manually control the browser using natural language (e.g., *"Go to Google and search for Playwright"*).
- **🔴 Auto-Recording**: Automatically converts your chat actions into ready-to-run **Playwright TypeScript** test code.
- **⚡ Autonomous Architect**: Loads test steps from Markdown files (`fixture/tests/`) and executes them automatically.
- **🛠️ Self-Healing**: AI automatically retries failed steps and corrects selectors dynamically.
- **🔌 MCP Integration**: Uses `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server` for standardized browser control.
